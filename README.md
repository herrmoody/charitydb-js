charitydb-js
============

A node.js web-app for maintaining an assistance database for a charity organization.

This project is in early development and is completely useless in its current state.  It will eventually consist of a central page which allows for searching and links to an add page, a set of pages for adding records, and a page for viewing and editing records.  It is written entirely in javascript (both server and client-side) with jade templates, sqlite as the database engine, and css for design.

It is being developed for a specific organization and is geared toward their needs but should be customizable to similar needs quite easily.
